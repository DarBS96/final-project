FeelEat application # final-project <br/>
<br/>
In this project, my goal was to create a project that best reflects me and the tools I have learned so far during the course. <br/>
Therefore, I built an interactive recipe site where users can get/create/edit/save/rate recipes based on their current mood. <br/>
I have used React with Redux Toolkit to manage the state most efficiently on the client's side. <br/>
On the server side, I have used Node.js with Express and PostgreSQL for the Database.
Moreover, I used JSON Web Token and encrypted passwords to authenticate the users. <br/>
Creating the project was very challenging and educational. I will appreciate any feedback and optimization suggestions.
